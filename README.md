# Healthy

This application is generated by Create React App and has React version downgraded to `17.0.2`.
It consumes data served by fake api at public route `/api`. This should be changed to integrate with an official backend.

## Start development

- Duplicate `.env.sample` as `.env.local` and set `REACT_APP_BASE_API_URL` to corresponding API url (don't change it if you want it to connect to the test API)
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run it in development mode: `npm start`
- Navigate to `localhost:3000`

## Build production

- Run `npm run build`
- Check the generated directory called `build` containing the resources ready for deployment

## Run test

- Run `npm run test`
- Follow instructions in console to run some or all tests

## Lint and auto-fix code

- When adding or updating code, should run `npm run lint` to automatically check and correct code style and potential issues
- Do commit the changes after that
